# Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning
# Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval status based on applicant data using machine learning. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies loan applications as either Approved or Rejected based on various financial and demographic factors.

# Workflow
# The project follows these key steps:
-	Data Collection – Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- Train-Test Split – Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection – Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
- Model Training – Training the SVM model on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using accuracy.
- New Data Prediction – Testing the model on new or unseen data.

# Dataset Details 
- Features: Various financial and personal attributes of loan applicants (e.g., income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, etc.).
- Target Variable: Loan approval status (Approved or Rejected).
- Data Source: The dataset was gotten from Kaggle. It is included in the project but should be properly preprocessed before training the model.

# Technologies & Libraries Used 
- Python
- VS Code
- NumPy – Numerical computations
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics

# Model Used
The project employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for loan status classification.
